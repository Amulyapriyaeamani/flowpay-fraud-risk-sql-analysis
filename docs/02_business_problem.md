# FlowPay — Fraud Risk & Platform Health Investigation

## Context

FlowPay is a growing digital payments startup experiencing rapid growth in user adoption and transaction volume across multiple cities.

Over the past few months, the leadership team has observed several concerning signals:

* Increase in fraud reports from users
* Rising transaction failures in certain payment methods
* Higher refund requests in specific merchant categories
* Suspicious transaction activity from newly created accounts

As transaction volume scales, even small increases in fraud or failures can significantly impact:

* Customer trust
* Platform reliability
* Revenue retention
* Operational costs

The Risk and Product teams have requested a detailed analytics investigation to better understand these issues.

This project simulates the work of an analytics team investigating **platform health and fraud risk patterns** using transactional data.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the overall health of the FlowPay platform and identify risk signals by analyzing user behavior, transaction patterns, and merchant activity.

The analysis aims to:

* Identify fraud patterns and suspicious transaction behavior
* Detect high-risk users and merchants
* Analyze transaction success and failure trends
* Understand how different payment methods perform
* Evaluate how fraud risk changes across time, categories, and user segments

Additionally, the project will develop a **fraud risk scoring approach** using behavioral signals derived from transaction data.

* Are certain cities or regions experiencing higher failure rates?

### Fraud Investigation

* Is fraud increasing over time?
* Which transaction characteristics are commonly associated with fraud?
* Are new users more likely to be involved in fraudulent transactions?
* Do high-value transactions have a higher fraud probability?

### User Risk Analysis

* Which users exhibit suspicious behavior patterns?
* Are there users performing unusually high numbers of transactions in short time periods?
* Does device switching correlate with fraud?

### Merchant Risk Analysis

* Which merchant categories show the highest fraud rates?
* Are certain merchants associated with a higher number of suspicious transactions?
* Are newly onboarded merchants riskier?

### Payment System Performance

* Which payment methods perform best and worst?
* Where are transaction failures happening most frequently?

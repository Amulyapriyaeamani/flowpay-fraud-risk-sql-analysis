Analysis Plan — Fraud & Payment Risk Investigation

This analysis follows a structured investigation similar to how analytics teams operate inside a digital payments company. The goal is to understand platform health, identify operational issues, and detect fraud patterns across users, merchants, and transactions.

1. Platform Health Check

The first step is to evaluate the overall health and growth of the platform.

Key checks:

Monthly transaction volume trend

Active users over time

Revenue processed by month

Transaction success vs failure rate

Refund rate

Payment method distribution (UPI, wallet, cards)

Goal:
Identify whether platform growth is stable and detect any unusual spikes or drops in activity.

Business value:
Provides a high-level view of platform performance before deep investigation.

2. Payment Performance Analysis

Next, we analyze how well the payment system is functioning.

Key checks:

Failure rate by payment method

Failure rate by device type

Failure rate by city

Average transaction processing outcomes

High-value transaction success vs failure

Goal:
Detect operational issues such as system errors, gateway issues, or payment method instability.

Business value:
Helps product and payments teams improve transaction reliability.

3. Merchant Risk Analysis

This step focuses on identifying merchants associated with abnormal or risky activity.

Key checks:

Fraud rate by merchant

Refund rate by merchant

High-risk merchant categories

Merchants with unusually high transaction velocity

Revenue concentration across merchants

Goal:
Detect merchants that may be enabling fraudulent or suspicious activity.

Business value:
Supports merchant monitoring and compliance decisions.

4. User Behavior Analysis

This section analyzes how users interact with the platform.

Key checks:

Average transactions per user

Average spend per user

Device switching behavior

Multi-city transaction activity

Rapid transaction attempts

High-value transaction users

Goal:
Understand behavioral patterns that may signal fraud or abnormal activity.

Business value:
Helps define behavioral risk indicators used in fraud detection systems.

5. Fraud Detection Investigation

This stage focuses specifically on identifying fraud patterns in the dataset.

Key checks:

Fraud rate over time

Fraud by payment method

Fraud by merchant category

Fraud by device type

Fraud by geography

Velocity fraud detection (rapid repeated transactions)

Goal:
Identify patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions.

Business value:
Improves fraud monitoring strategies and supports risk operations.

6. Risk Model (Behavior-Based Risk Scoring)

Finally, a simple risk scoring framework will be created using behavioral indicators.

Risk signals may include:

High transaction velocity

Multiple devices per user

Transactions across many cities

High refund activity

High-risk merchant interaction

Failed transaction patterns

Output:
Users and merchants will be assigned a risk score to identify potential fraud clusters.

Business value:
Demonstrates how analytics insights can evolve into risk models used by fraud teams.
